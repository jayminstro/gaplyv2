## Summary of Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **types/index.tsx** - Removed calendar_include_weekends, quiet_hours_start, quiet_hours_end
2. **utils/constants.tsx** - Removed default values and fixed type issues
3. **components/SettingsContent.tsx** - Removed UI elements for removed preferences
4. **hooks/usePreferences.tsx** - Removed preference handling logic
5. **utils/gapLogic.tsx** - Simplified gap creation logic
6. **utils/api/preferenceValidation.ts** - Removed validation rules
7. **utils/storage/PreferenceManager.ts** - Removed storage handling
8. **utils/storage/PreferenceChangeDetector.ts** - Removed change detection
9. **utils/storage/EnhancedStorageManager.ts** - Removed storage operations
10. **supabase/functions/server/index.tsx** - Removed server-side logic
11. **components/PlannerContent.tsx** - Updated to use simplified logic
12. **components/PlannerTimeline.tsx** - Updated to use simplified logic
13. **components/WidgetView.tsx** - Fixed property name issue

### Benefits Achieved:
- **Simplified UX**: One time range (work hours) instead of two separate preferences
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated redundant logic and validation
- **Better Alignment**: Work hours serve as single source of truth for all time-based decisions
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed ~200 lines of redundant code
- **Improved Maintainability**: Fewer preferences to manage and debug

### Testing Status:
- âœ… **Build Process**: App builds successfully without errors
- âœ… **TypeScript Compilation**: Critical errors resolved
- âœ… **Development Server**: App starts and runs without runtime errors
- ðŸ”„ **Manual Testing**: Ready for user testing of simplified preferences

## Next Steps
- [ ] **Manual Testing**: Test the simplified settings UI and verify all functionality works
- [ ] **User Acceptance**: Confirm the simplified approach meets user needs
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update any user-facing documentation about the changes
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Verify the simplified logic improves performance

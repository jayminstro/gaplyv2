## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** as the primary design system
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Motion/React** for animations
- **Sonner** for toast notifications

### Backend
- **Supabase** for backend services
- **Hono** web server for edge functions
- **PostgreSQL** with Row Level Security
- **OAuth 2.0** for Google Calendar integration

### Development Tools
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code quality

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account
- Google Cloud Console account (for calendar integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gaply.git
   cd gaply
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase and Google credentials:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_supabase_project_id
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   
   # Google OAuth Configuration
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_oauth_client_secret
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   The application uses a proper relational database structure with the following Supabase tables:
   - `user_preferences` - User settings, work hours, and calendar preferences
   - `tasks` - Task management with timestamptz due dates and scheduling
   - `calendar_gaps` - Time gap detection and management from calendar data
   - `scheduled_gaps` - Manually created and scheduled time blocks
   - `explore` - Activity suggestions and discovery (Note: API endpoint is `/explore`, not `/discover`)
   - `activity_completions` - Completion tracking and analytics
   
   All tables use Row Level Security (RLS) and are linked through user_id foreign key relationships.

5. **Google Calendar Integration** (Required for Full Functionality)
   - Set up OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console
   - Configure redirect URIs in Supabase Auth settings
   - Add GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET to environment variables
   - Follow the [Supabase Auth Google setup guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google)
   - **Important**: Without proper Google OAuth setup, users will see "provider is not enabled" errors

6. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

- [ ] Advanced calendar features (recurring events, reminders)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

### Setup Requirements
- Google Calendar sync requires manual OAuth 2.0 credential setup in Google Cloud Console
- Missing Google OAuth credentials will result in "provider is not enabled" errors
- Widget mode requires specific URL parameter (?widget=true) to activate

### Technical Limitations
- Timer accuracy may vary on background tabs due to browser throttling
- Some edge cases in gap splitting logic under heavy concurrent usage
- Mobile keyboard may affect modal positioning on smaller screens
- Calendar sync is currently one-way (Gaply → Google Calendar) for task creation

### Browser Compatibility
- Optimized for modern mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge)
- PWA features require HTTPS for full functionality
- Clipboard API requires user permission for widget URL sharing

# Calendar Event Modal Implementation

## Overview
A new modal component has been implemented to display calendar event details when users click on calendar events in the Planner Timeline.

## Features

### Modal Content
- **Title**: Event title with fallback to "Busy Time" for minimal events
- **Time & Duration**: Start/end times with calculated duration
- **Organizer**: Event organizer (if available)
- **Attendees Count**: Number of attendees (if available)
- **Conferencing Link**: Join meeting button for video conferences (if available)
- **Notes Preview**: Expandable event description with preview
- **Location**: Event location (if available)
- **Footer Button**: "Open in Calendar" button

### Design
- Follows the app's sleek design patterns
- Uses consistent color scheme (red theme for calendar events)
- Responsive layout with proper spacing
- Hover effects and transitions
- Expandable notes section

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified
1. **`components/CalendarEventModal.tsx`** - New modal component
2. **`components/PlannerTimeline.tsx`** - Updated to handle calendar event clicks

### Data Structure
The modal accepts calendar events with this interface:
```typescript
interface CalendarEvent {
  id: string;
  start: Date;
  end: Date;
  title: string;
  isAllDay?: boolean;
  organizer?: string;
  attendees?: Array<{...}>;
  conferenceData?: {...};
  description?: string;
  location?: string;
}
```

### Integration
- Calendar events in the timeline are now clickable
- Clicking opens the modal with event details
- Modal state is managed in PlannerTimeline component
- Proper cleanup when modal is closed

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to Planner Timeline
2. Click on any calendar event (red blocks)
3. View event details in the modal
4. Use "Open in Calendar" to access the full event

### For Developers
```tsx
import { CalendarEventModal } from './components/CalendarEventModal';

<CalendarEventModal
  event={selectedEvent}
  isOpen={modalOpen}
  onClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}
/>
```

## Future Enhancements
- Implement actual "Open in Calendar" functionality using device calendar APIs
- Add event editing capabilities
- Support for recurring events
- Better handling of all-day events
- Integration with Google Calendar API for richer event data

## Technical Notes
- Uses existing UI components (Dialog, Button, etc.)
- Follows established design patterns
- Handles both rich calendar events and minimal busy blocks
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
